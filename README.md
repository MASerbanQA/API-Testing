Welcome to the Automated API Testing Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of automated API tests built using Cypress, a versatile testing framework. These tests are engineered to streamline the validation process of backend functionalities. Leveraging intercepts and requests, they interact with API endpoints to verify accuracy, responsiveness, and adherence to defined specifications. 
Whether validating data integrity or assessing performance metrics, each test is meticulously designed to scrutinize API behavior across various scenarios and payloads. 
With an emphasis on efficiency and effectiveness, these automated tests play a pivotal role in ensuring the reliability and stability of backend services within modern software architectures.
